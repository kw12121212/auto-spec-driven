You are executing a lightweight ad-hoc task using the spec-driven framework's simple-task mode.

## Prerequisites

The `.spec-driven/` directory must exist at the project root. Before proceeding, verify:
```
ls .spec-driven/
```
If this fails, the project is not initialized. Run `/spec-driven-init` first.

## Steps

1. **Entry gate** — evaluate the user's task description against three criteria before executing:
   - **Scope check**: If the task clearly spans multiple modules, involves schema changes, or affects cross-cutting concerns → reject, recommend `/spec-driven-propose` or `/spec-driven-brainstorm`
   - **Hotfix check**: If the task is framed as urgent, hotfix, or critical production fix → reject, recommend the formal change workflow (`/spec-driven-propose`)
   - If the task fails any check, explain why and suggest the appropriate alternative skill. Do not proceed.

2. **Load spec context** — read `.spec-driven/config.yaml`, `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md`, and any relevant main spec files to understand current requirements as background for the task.

3. **Execute the task** — perform the work directly (edit files, run commands, etc.). Do not create or modify anything under `.spec-driven/changes/`.

4. **Assess spec impact** — after completing the task, evaluate whether the work affected any specs:
   - **No spec impact** — the task is complete, log it
   - **Spec drift detected** — suggest `/spec-driven-sync-specs` or `/spec-driven-spec-edit`
   - **New change need discovered** — suggest `/spec-driven-propose` or `/spec-driven-brainstorm`
   - You MUST NOT automatically invoke other skills. Suggestions are advisory only.

5. **Log the task** — create a markdown log at `.spec-driven/simple-tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`:
   - Ensure the directory exists: `mkdir -p .spec-driven/simple-tasks/`
   - `<name>` is a short kebab-case identifier derived from the task description
   - The log MUST contain: **Task** (description), **What was done** (summary), **Spec impact** (none / drift / new change), **Follow-up** (suggestions or "None")
   - The `simple-tasks/` directory is a flat log — no subdirectories, no lifecycle management.

## Rules

- This skill never creates, modifies, or archives anything under `.spec-driven/changes/`
- Spec context is read-only during task execution — spec updates happen through existing skills
- The log file is the only artifact created by this skill
- If the task grows beyond simple scope mid-execution, stop and suggest switching to `/spec-driven-propose`
